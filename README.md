# Logistic_Regression
The goal of this project was to build a Logistic Regression model within R. In doing this, I examined and cleaned the data, performed descriptive statistics, prepared the data, built a Logistic Regression model, built a confusion matrix, and reported insights.

The project was summarized in the attached PowerPoint Presentation.
